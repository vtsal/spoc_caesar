    Architecture description:
        Implementation of SpoC-64, with c=128, b=192, n=128, and t=64. Basic iterative architecture where 1 round of the sLiSCP-light-[192] permutation is executed in 1 clock cycle.
        
    Key setup time:
        0

    Execution time of authenticated encryption:
        219 + Na*109 + Nm*111

    Execution time of authenticated decryption:
        219 + Na*109 + Nm*111

    Non-default generic settings:
        G_W = 32
        G_SW = 32
